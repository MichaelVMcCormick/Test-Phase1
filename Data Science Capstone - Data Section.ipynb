Use the file to create a choropleth map of neighboorhood density by adding data from the US Census bureau. \n    Additional data from 2009\u20132013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates would show income level averages within each neighboorhood for potential analysis. \n4) Using the Forsquare API to get the most common venues/attractions within each neighborhood and square. \n5) Additional information will be added if further questions arise during the analysis phase. \n",
